Feedback:

Ex 1: It is especially important that during the training phase we have similar numbers of conditions. Good work making the blocks longer too.  
Ex 6: Nice explanation but actually when you try really small batch sizes the model might be overfitting and only learning what that block looks like.  
N: Nice.
